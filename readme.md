# Inventory Management System

## Description

The Inventory Management RESTful API is a personal project aimed at showcasing my skills in developing robust, scalable, and efficient web applications. The core functionality revolves around the `InventoryItem` entity, which represents an item in the inventory with attributes such as `name`, `description`, `quantity`, and `amount`.

This project is built using Java, leveraging the Spring Boot framework for creating the RESTful API, Spring Data JPA for database interactions, and MySQL as the database system. It also incorporates Spring Security for securing the API endpoints and Maven for build automation. Docker is used for containerization, ensuring the application can be easily deployed and scaled.
